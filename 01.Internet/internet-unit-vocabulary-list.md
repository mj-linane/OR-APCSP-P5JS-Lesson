[UNIT 1 – THE INTERNET](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/)
------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Lesson 1: Personal Innovations](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/1/)

- **Innovation**: A new or improved idea, device, product, etc, or the development thereof

### [Lesson 2: Sending Binary Messages](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/2/)

- **Binary**: A way of representing information using only two options.
- **Bit**: A contraction of “Binary Digit”; the single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1

### [Lesson 3: Sending Binary Messages with the Internet Simulator](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/3/)

- **Bandwidth**: Transmission capacity measure by bit rate
- **Bit**: A contraction of “Binary Digit”; the single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1
- **Bit rate**: (sometimes written bitrate) the number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time. e.g. 8 bits/sec.
- **Latency**: Time it takes for a bit to travel from its sender to its receiver.
- **Protocol**: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.

### [Lesson 6: Sending Numbers](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/6/)

- **Protocol**: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.

### [Lesson 7: Sending Text](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/7/)

- **Abstraction**: a simplified representation of something more complex. Abstractions allow you to hide details to help you manage complexity, focus on relevant concepts, and reason about problems at a higher level.
- **ASCII**: American Standard Code for Information Interchange; the universally recognized raw text format that any computer can understand
- **Protocol**: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.

### [Lesson 8: The Internet Is for Everyone](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/8/)

- **IETF**: Internet Engineering Task Force – develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards and protocols, in particular the standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).
- **Internet**: A group of computers and servers that are connected to each other.
- **Net Neutrality**: the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally by Internet Service Providers.

### [Lesson 9: The Need for Addressing](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/9/)

- **IP Address**: A number assigned to any item that is connected to the Internet.
- **Packets**: Small chunks of information that have been carefully formed from larger chunks of information.
- **Protocol**: A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.

### [Lesson 10: Routers and Redundancy](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/10/)

- **Network Redundancy**: having multiple backups to ensure reliability during cases of high usage or failure
- **Router**: A type of computer that forwards data across a network

### [Lesson 11: Packets and Making a Reliable Internet](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/11/)

- **Packets**: Small chunks of information that have been carefully formed from larger chunks of information.
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol – provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of packets on the internet. TCP is tightly linked with IP and usually seen as TCP/IP in writing.

### [Lesson 12: The Need for DNS](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/12/)

- **DNS**: short for Domain Name System, this system translates domain names (like example.com) to IP addresses (like 93.184.216.34)

### [Lesson 13: HTTP and Abstraction on the Internet](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/13/)

- **DNS**: short for Domain Name System, this system translates domain names (like example.com) to IP addresses (like 93.184.216.34)
- **HTTP**: HyperText Transfer Protocol – the protocol used for transmitting web pages over the Internet
- **IP Address**: A number assigned to any item that is connected to the Internet.
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol – provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of packets on the internet. TCP is tightly linked with IP and usually seen as TCP/IP in writing.
- **URL**: An easy-to-remember address for calling a web page (like www.code.org).

### [Lesson 14: Practice PT – The Internet and Society](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit1/14/)

- **DNS**: short for Domain Name System, this system translates domain names (like example.com) to IP addresses (like 93.184.216.34)
- **HTTP**: HyperText Transfer Protocol – the protocol used for transmitting web pages over the Internet
- **IP Address**: A number assigned to any item that is connected to the Internet.
- **Net Neutrality**: the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally by Internet Service Providers.
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol – provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of packets on the internet. TCP is tightly linked with IP and usually seen as TCP/IP in writing.
