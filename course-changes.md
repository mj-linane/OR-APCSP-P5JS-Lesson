# AP CSP Course Changes (Updated 3/24/2020)

## Official AP CSP Test Changes (Updated 3/24/20)

I am not sure if you all have seen the update from College Board so I share them here in brief. I will post another thread with our ORR course changes.

1. _No Multiple Choice_
2. _Explore Task and Create Tasks count towards your final score_
3. _Explore and Create Tasks are all due all May 26 at 11:59 p.m. ET_

## ORR Course Changes (Updated 3/24/20)

### Test Prep

_We will immediately pause all multiple choice test prep and focus our efforts on getting your program ready to submit._

### Explore Task

_This was your research task we did in December. This should be done and submitted._

### Create Task And Course Changes

#### 1. Writing Your Final Program

_Are you prepared to write your final program? Yes. We have officially covered all of the programming concepts and skills you need to write your program and submit it to College Board._

#### 2. More Coding Practice Will Help

_The more you know, the easier writing this program will be. To this end, I am going to continue to post and cover a couple more topics I think are fundamental to understanding any computer language, things like arrays and returning values from functions. The delayed submission timeline allows us more time to practice._

#### 3. New Preview Lessons Posted

_I will post the lessons on mycodingclass as "preview" lessons. These are not due when we get back and the school nor will they be entered for a grade while we are not in school. Once we get back, I will cover these topics and will require one more coding project (Image Scroller App) for a grade in term 4 that cover these concepts. Going through the exercises now will give you a head start to write the final app._

#### 4. New Course Calendar

_I have revised the course schedule and posted it on mycodingclass. This covers the topics that will be posted each week and the weekly topics and projects due from now until the deadline (See course calendar)._

#### 5. Coding Help on Google Hangouts Chat

_I am more than happy to answer your coding questions, I would like all code related questions to be posted on the school Google Hangouts Chat: AP CSP Support 19-20. You should have received an invite in your email. Please feel free to post your code and to respond to other's posts. I will be checking regularly for new questions but I have 2 young boys at home with me that I am trying to keep from destroying my house. So, I might not be the first to see a new thread. If you see something you can help with, help out :)_

#### 6. Next Steps You Should Take

_That being said, while you are home, I strongly encourage you to do one of the following things:_

- _Complete any missing work, including finishing the color finder app._
- _Practice your if statements, Khan Academy has some great practice activities:_ https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/logic-if-statements/pt/if-statements or freecodecamp.org
- _Go through the weekly preview lesson puzzles and activities. I will be posting more this week and next._
- _If you are really ahead or feeling comfortable with your coding experience, start drafting the final app/website. It will probably take a couple of test to figure out what exactly you want to/can do in the time we are given. I will be posting more guidance on this in the coming weeks (See course calendar)._
