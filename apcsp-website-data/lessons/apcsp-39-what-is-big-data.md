Overview
--------

Big data is a big deal right now, both in the field of computer science and more broadly across fields and industries. Understanding the types of things that can be captured in data and anticipating the types of innovations or new knowledge that can be built upon this data is increasingly the role of the computer scientist. A first step toward understanding big data is a survey of how big data is already being used to learn and solve problems across numerous disciplines. The scale of big data makes it hard to “see” sometimes, and techniques for looking at, working with, and understanding data change once the data is “big.” Everything, from how it’s stored to how it’s processed to how it’s visualized, is a little different once you enter the realm of big data.

Vocab
-----

- **Big Data** – a broad term for datasets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate.
- **Moore’s Law** – a predication made by Gordon Moore in 1965 that computing power will double every 1.5-2 years, it has remained more or less true ever since.

Opportunities and Problems of Big Data
--------------------------------------

### Opportunities

**Video:** [Big data is better data – TED talk – Video](https://www.ted.com/talks/kenneth_cukier_big_data_is_better_data)

**Question:** Based on what you saw in the video, what is big data?

### Challenges

**Video:** [AI, Ain’t I a Woman? – Joy Buolamwini – Video](https://youtu.be/QxuyfWoVV98)

**Questions:** What is the problem that is presented in the video? How do you think this came about? What concerns to you have about big data after watching the video?

 Exponential Growth and Moore’s Law 
------------------------------------

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://code.org/curriculum/docs/csp/moores_law_chart.png)</figure>There is a principle in computer science known as **Moore’s Law**.

[Moore’s Law – Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)

It is not a law of nature or mathematics but simply a surprisingly accurate prediction that was made a long time ago. In 1965, a computer chip designer named Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors one could fit on a chip would double every 18 months or so.

Amazingly, that prediction has more or less held true to the present day! The result is that since about 1970, computers have gotten twice as fast, at half the cost, roughly every 1.5-2 years. With some small differences, the same is true for data storage capacity.

This is extraordinarily fast growth – we call it exponential growth. With more and more machines that are faster and faster, the amount of data being pushed around, saved, and processed is growing exponentially. This is so fast that it’s hard to fathom and even harder to plan for. For example:

- If the average hard drive today is 1 TB and you are planning for something or 6 years away, you should expect that average hard drives will be 8-10 TB.

**Key Takeaway:** We need to keep Moore’s Law in mind as we plan for the future.

 Big Data Sleuth Card
---------------------

 [Activity Guide – Big Data Sleuth Card – Activity Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rGwDE3QzvLsiQHUfDz4n9JHjgEZBDqoQ--yleDXZm3s/edit?usp=sharing).

In pairs, cook at one of the following websites:

1. Web archive http://www.archive.org
2. Measure of America http://www.measureofamerica.org/maps/
3. Wind Sensor network http://earth.nullschool.net/
4. Twitter sentiment https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/tweet\_viz/tweet\_app/
5. Alternative Fuel Locator http://www.afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/

Big Data Wrap Up
----------------

1. What kinds of data are out there?
2. What format does it come it?
3. Where does it come from?
4. Did anyone find a link to an actual data source?
5. Did anyone find an API? What’s an API?

Going Further
-------------

**Open Data:** You might be interested in looking at some of the publicly available datasets provided at these sites. It can take a little digging, but you can see the raw datasets and some of the applications that have been made from them.

- [Weather.gov](http://weather.gov/)
- [Open Data (opendata.socrata.com)](http://opendata.socrata.com/)
- [Open Data Network (www.opendatanetwork.com/)](http://www.opendatanetwork.com/)

**Google Maps Traffic:** Another big data resource that you may use every day:

- Go to [maps.google.com](https://maps.google.com/) and zoom in on your town or city.
- Turn on the Live Traffic view for your area or a nearby town or city.
- The map should show real-time traffic data.
- Try to answer the same questions that were on the Big Data Sleuth Card. This may take a little more research, since the sources of the data aren’t as clearly marked.
