Overview
--------

You use the Google Trends tool in order to visualize historical search data. You will need to identify interesting trends or patterns in their findings and will attempt to explain those trends, based on their own experience or through further research online. Afterwards, you will present their findings to ensure you are correctly identifying patterns in a visualization and are providing plausible explanations of those patterns.

Exploring Google Trends
-----------------------

**Activity Guide – [Exploring Trends – Activity Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J9bwOirLAdrN48UFw4p9BdqJT6Js3kRWhDqsOZi4Pyg/)**

### Let’s Practice

- Let’s pick a random search term
- What the trend might be showing?
- Let’s add a second term to our visualization and discuss quickly what it might be showing.
- Let’s change the the time periods, regions, etc.

### Your Turn

#### Research

**You will use [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/explore)**

- Individually or in pairs to identify topics you wish to examine in greater detail.
- You should spend some time just exploring the tool, but eventually you will need to choose a single topic or set of topics that you will use to answer the questions that appear on the bottom of the activity guide.

#### **Tell a Story**

You should find a trend or set of trends you think is particularly interesting or personally relevant and try to tell a story from the data you see. You will write down:

- A description of what you were trying to look for
- An accurate description of what the visualization is showing
- A plausible explanation of why that trend might have happened.

### Sharing Your Data Story

Each of you or your group or will only take a minute or so to present your chart and story, after which your viewers might ask you questions or add their own interpretations of the chart. Good questions might include:

- Is the story you told supported by the chart?
- Are there other ways to interpret the chart?
- Are there additional terms you’d also like to see shown on the chart?
