Plicker Question #2016.14
-------------------------

The figure below shows a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially facing upward. The robot can move into a white or gray square but cannot move into a black region.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![A 5 by 5 grid, with one gray square and the others either black or white. One of the squares contains a triangle, representing a robot, facing the top of the grid. The white squares represent a path through the grid that staffs at the robot's square and ends at the gray square. The squares of the grid are filled as follows, from left to right and top to bottom: Row one: black, black, black, black, gray. Row two: black, black, black, black, white. Row three: white white white white white. Row four: white, black, black, black, black. Row five: robot facing the top of grid, black, black, black, black. ](https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/1f6390954cf12da8f5b8c3b0b4df86fa/original.png)</figure></div>Consider the procedure *MoveAndTurn* below.

Plicker Question #2016.5
------------------------

The following question uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom left square of the grid and facing right.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![A 5 by 5 grid with a right-facing triangle at the bottom of the first column.](https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/bfa68aa2bf9129451143ca35e402b392/original.png)</figure></div>Consider the following code segment, which moves the robot in the grid.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![The block code consists of six lines. Some of the lines of code are indented. Line one: begin block, n, left arrow, three end block.  Begin block Line two: in capital letters, REPEAT 3 TIMES Begin block Begin block Line three indented one tab, reads REPEAT n TIMES.  Line four, indented two tabs, reads MOVE underscore FORWARD. Line five indented one tab, reads ROTATE underscore LEFT. Line six, indented one tab, reads n left arrow n minus one.
