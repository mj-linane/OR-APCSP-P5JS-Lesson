- **Algorithm**: A precise sequence of instructions for processes that can be executed by a computer.
- **Abstraction**: a simplified representation of something more complex. Abstractions allow you to hide details to help you manage complexity, focus on relevant concepts, and reason about problems at a higher level.
- **High Level Programming Language**: A programming language with many commands and features designed to make common tasks easier to program. Any high level functionality is encapsulated as combinations of low level commands.
- **Low Level Programming Language**: A programming language that captures only the most primitive operations available to a machine. Anything that a computer can do can be represented with combinations of low level commands.
- **Iterate**: To repeat in order to achieve, or get closer to, a desired goal.
- **Selection**: A generic term for a type of programming statement (usually an if-statement) that uses a Boolean condition to determine, or select, whether or not to run a certain block of statements.
- **Sequencing**: Putting commands in correct order so computers can read the commands.
- **Function**<span style="font-size: 1rem;">: A named group of programming instructions. Functions are reusable abstractions that reduce the complexity of writing and maintaining programs.</span>
- **Top Down Design**: a problem solving approach (also known as stepwise design) in which you break down a system to gain insight into the sub-systems that make it up.
- **API**: a collection of commands made available to a programmer
- **Documentation**: a description of the behavior of a command, function, library, API, etc.
- **Hexadecimal**: A base-16 number system that uses sixteen distinct symbols 0-9 and A-F to represent numbers from 0 to 15.
- **Library**: a collection of commands / functions, typically with a shared purpose
- **Parameter**: An extra piece of information passed to a function to customize it for a specific need
- **For Loop**: Loops that have a predetermined beginning, end, and increment (step interval).
