Overview
--------

In this lesson we look deeper into why we separate the **what** from the **why** when looking at data. The main purpose here is to raise awareness of the assumptions that we (all people) make when looking at data and try to call them out. Some of these assumptions lie hidden beneath the surface and we want to shed some light on them by looking at some examples from the news.

Analyzing and interpreting data will typically require some assumptions to be made about the accuracy of the data and the cause of the relationships observed within it. When decisions are made based on a collection of data, they will often rest just as much on that set of assumptions about the data as the data itself. Identifying and validating (or disproving) assumptions is therefore an important part of data analysis. Furthermore, clear communication about how data was interpreted should also include an account of the assumptions made along the way.
