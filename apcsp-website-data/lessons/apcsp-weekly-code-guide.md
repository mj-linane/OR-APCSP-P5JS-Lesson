Purpose
-------

To practice rapidly prototyping a program.

- - - - - -

Objectives
==========

- Identify a problem to be solved with a computer program.
- Draft an algorithm to solve the problem.
- Write a prototype program that solves that problem.

- - - - - -

Deliverables
------------

1. A weblink (Repl, GitHub, AppLab, etc) or files that have your code.
2. One Time -&gt; Can substitute writing code for the week with digital mockups of app screens using the Code.org App designer, Figma Web Designer, HTML and CSS.
3. Weekly discussion post summarizing the challenges of your work

### Time Requirement

90 minutes per week or more hours (voluntary):

1. Identify problem/goal
2. Draft algorithm
3. Write/test code

Rules
-----

### **Not Reasonable**

- Use the same logic you have already written for this class. So, no color pickers or clicker games.
- Work on late exercises.
- Using someone else’s code and just submit it running on your IDE after you copy/pasted.
- Get a classmate to write the code for you.
- Get or receive a program from another student as a way to “get started”.
- Submit a program that doesn’t run. (It doesn’t need all of the features finished but what is there should, at least, run)
- Complete all of them in a single week. This isn’t a race. This process will be more effective for you if you space out the time between starting new projects.
- Writing programs that consist mainly of any of the UI onEvent(), mouseClicks, and/or console.log() functions. These pre-built functions represent beginner skills that you obtained in the first few exercises of JavaScript. Writing these apps will not adequately prepare you to meet the course objectives. Push yourself.

### **Reasonable**

- Write a mini-program. We don’t need you to create the new Instagram. A simple program that takes about an hour to draft the algorithm, write the code, and test will meet the weekly requirement.
- Use online tutorials. I wouldn’t rely on this 100%. If you can, try to write as much as you can from your own knowledge
- Draft an original algorithm (this is encouraged).
- Take an algorithm written in pseudocode and turn it into a program.
- Leave the project with unfinished features. This one can be tough because you want to build something awesome. But under the circumstances and time constraints, a fully featured app or game is not our goal. The goal is to get you the experience of drafting algorithms and writing code.
- Code a new feature each week if you want to try and draft something that is part of a larger project.

Submission
----------

1 Submission per week

1. Code
2. Responses

All code/designs must be able to be submitted by a link to a Repl, Code.org AppLab or some other location. If you have a unique program you are writing let me know and I can work it out with you.
