Purpose
-------

### Numbering Systems

In computer science it’s common to move between different representations of numbers. Typically we see numbers represented in decimal (base-10), binary (base-2), and hexadecimal (base-16). The symbols of the decimal (base-10) number system – 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 – are so familiar that it can be challenging to mentally separate the written symbols from the abstract values they represent. As a result, using the digits 0 and 1 can be a distraction when learning binary initially, so we don’t in this lesson.

We want to expose the fact that numbers themselves (quantities) are laws of nature, but the symbols we use to represent numbers are an arbitrary, man-made abstraction. As long as you have 1) a set of distinct symbols 2) an agreement about how those symbols should be ordered, then you can represent any number with them.

### Binary

Number systems help us express and reason about quantities. Early number systems were merely a system of tallies that allowed humans to record and perform simple arithmetic with values. The number system we use today uses the concept of place value to allow us to express any value we wish by combining only 10 symbols (0, 1, 2 …). We therefore call it a “base 10” number system. When developing a number system for a computer, we only have two symbols available to us, corresponding with the two states of a single bit. However, the power of place value allows our binary or “base 2” number system to express any value we wish.

When using this binary representation of numbers, certain values (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) are seen repeatedly. When written in binary, these values are 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and so on, and so are the incremental place values in this binary number system.

Create A Numbering System Using Symbols

### Challenge 1 – Find all of the 3-place patternsbols

- **Record all** of the unique 3-place patterns you can find in the template started below.
- **How many are there?** Number each one to keep track. (Note there may be more or fewer total patterns than spaces provided)

### Challenge 2 – make a system for generating all the patterns

Now that you’ve listed out all of the 3-place patterns of circles, triangles, and squares, let’s put them in a systematic order. You can use any system you like, as long as you create and follow a clear set of rules for getting from one line to the next.
