Vocabulary
----------

- **Algorithm** – A list of steps to finish a task.
- **High Level Programming Language** – A programming language with many commands and features designed to make common tasks easier to program. Any high level functionality is encapsulated as combinations of low level commands.
- **Low Level Programming Language** – A programming language that captures only the most primitive operations available to a machine. Anything that a computer can do can be represented with combinations of low level commands.

### Programming Language Swap

1. Create your song using Google Melody Maker: <https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Melody-Maker/>
2. Write down the instructions that someone else could follow to create the same song.
3. Share with someone else the steps you developed to make your song.
