Overview
--------

Last class, we looked at ways that data we willingly give away could be lost and used to compromise our security. What we often don’t think about, however, is just how much data is being collected about us without us even knowing it. Especially as computers become ever more powerful and ubiquitous, it is becoming easier for vast amounts of data about us to be collected and for it to be used for a variety of purposes.

Many consumers are unaware, or lack a sophisticated understanding, of how information about us is being collected and tracked by the technology we use every day. This issue goes beyond instances when data is stolen from companies or organizations we willingly provide it to. Instead, using computational tools, our movements through the physical and virtual world are being automatically tracked, stored, and analyzed. Cookies in our browsers keep a record of our movements on the Internet. Companies trade access to free tools and apps for the rights to track the data we upload to them. Advertisers develop personalized profiles of potential customers to better target advertising. Governments monitor traffic across the Internet at scales unimaginable without the use of computers. Yet we live in a world that increasingly relies on these digital tools, services and products. Most companies make great efforts to balance the tradeoffs between utility and privacy, but the issues can be tricky and raise confounding ethical dilemmas. We must now grapple with a question of just how much we value our privacy, and whether it is even possible to maintain in a digitized world.

**Info to write down for each site:**

1. **Name of Website** / Service
2. **Do you have an account**, or need to login?
3. **What kinds of data** does (or could) this site potentially collect about you?
4. Do you know **if this data is shared with other people**, companies or organizations? (If so, which ones?)
5. Do you know **how you would find out** what data is collected or how it’s shared?

**Example Types of sites:**

### Discussion

- *“Right now, which way are you leaning? Too little privacy? Right amount?*“
- *“Are you willing to give up some privacy (and potentially some security) to have free access to modern innovative tools – do you trust companies to be good stewards of your data?*“
- *“Are you concerned? Do you think too much of your data is out of your control? Do you think too much personally identifiable data is given over to someone else?”*
- *“What other questions do you have?”*
