## Questions

**Question: Will we be allowed to use outside sites in our code, such as a link to a site for name generators if we are creating a database for writing tips/how to write a story that is wholly your own?**

_You can use code that is not your own as long as you cite it within your program as clearly not being yours and don't try to include it in your open response_

**Can I use code that I find online which solves a problem applicable to my program and adjust it slightly to make it fit or do I have to manually type out every line on my own?**

_Finding code online and rewriting it or copy/pasting it doesn't make a difference. You can use code that is not your own as long as you cite it within your program as clearly not being yours and don't try to include it in your open response_

**Will you provide a rough schedule for us to follow?**

_Yes, the student survival guide above includes a timeline._

**Can the app be a game?**

_Absolutely! Game engines are perfectly fine to use as well, meaning Unity, Unreal, Roblox, etc._

**For the responses should we just answer them on a google doc? or is there a template to use.**

_There will be a template provided in the student templates above._

**Are we going to get any feedback/class wide suggestions to help with creating our programs? I know that were not supposed to get any help with our specific code, but i think there's going to be a lot of other questions.**

_It is my suggestion that you try to develop this idea on your own so that you can write about it fully in the open response. That being said, I know how helpful feedback is in idea generation so I would say consult with others to help you get started on an idea but then develop it yourself._

**You can't give us any feedback of any sort, correct?**

_Correct, I cannot. But...just like with the Explore Task, if you have a question, ask me! I would be happy to help if I can, and if I can't I will let you know._

**Do you suggest that we also use the Code.org AppLab that was in the video or use something else?**

_The exam doesn't really care what language you use. AppLab works great, I have had students receive full credit on this portion of the exam using AppLab. You can use Scratch, JavaScript, Python, basically any modern coding language will do. If you have a question about a particular language/project just ask me. But generally my guidance is this: follow your heart. Whatever tool you find to be the easiest to use, use it._

**If we use the app tool on code.org is there a way that we can entirely write out our code and not use block code? And if not is Repl.it ok to use instead?**

_Yes, in the top right of the editor, there is a "show code" button. Click that to toggle the blocks to script._

**Does the Code.org AppLab recognize p5js?**

_No. You will have to write P5js in Repl or in local files on VSCode._

_P5js is someone's interpretation of JavaScript. Their own shortcuts. AppLab is another interpretation of JavaScript that has its own shortcuts through the blocks. You can use vanilla JavaScript with both, although I find AppLab complains a bit more when I try to use some vanilla JavaScript functions. My guess is that they have shadowed some of the function names inside of their block code. That being said, AppLab is just JavaScript._
