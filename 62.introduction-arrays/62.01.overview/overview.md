## Overview

You will learn about arrays in JavaScript as a means of storing lists of information within a program. You will build a simple app, My Favorite Things, which stores and cycles through a list of words describing their favorite things.

### Vocabulary

1. **Array** - A data structure in JavaScript used to represent a list.
2. **List** - A generic term for a programming data structure that holds multiple items.

### New Code

All of the following methods are things we do to arrays.

1. let list = ["a", "b", "c"]
2. list.shift() Removes the first element of an array, and returns that element
3. list.slice() Selects a part of an array, and returns the new array
4. list.forEach() Calls a function for each array element
5. list.includes() Check if an array contains the specified element
6. list.pop() Removes the last element of an array, and returns that element
7. list.push() Adds new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length
8. list.sort() Sorts the elements of an array
9. list.splice() Adds/Removes elements from an array
