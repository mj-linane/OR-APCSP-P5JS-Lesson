## 10 Streaks of Heads: 12 in a Row

We're almost ready to test our second hypothesis and find out how long it takes to get 12 heads in a row. Just as before we're first going to visually test our code with a different length streak (4) before removing most of the visual output and running the code for a streak of 12.

### Do This: Streak of 12

1. Change your simulation to run until you get a streak of 4 and visually verify that the values calculated are accurate.
2. Comment out the lines of code that write the current coin flip and the current streak count. You can use to comment out a single line of code.
3. Change your simulation to run until you get a streak of 12 heads.
4. Run your simulation a few times and record your results!
