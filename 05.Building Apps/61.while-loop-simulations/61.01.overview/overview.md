# While Loop Simulations Student Lesson Plan

## 1 Overview

In this lesson, you will create an website that will simulate the flipping of a coin. Now, the trick here is that this coin flipping program is going to model an experiment that while possible for a human to do, it is unreasonable.

You are going to write the program to use loops to flip a coin continuously until certain conditions are met.

## Vocabulary

- Models and Simulations: a program which replicates or mimics key features of a real world event in order to investigate its behavior without the cost, time, or danger of running an experiment in real life.
