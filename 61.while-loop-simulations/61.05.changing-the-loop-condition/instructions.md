## 5 Change the Loop Condition - Counting Heads

We want our simulation to run while the streak of heads is less than a target length. In order to do this we'll need to change our looping condition to use the variables we've been using to count our streak of heads. To begin with your simulation should look for a streak of 3 heads so that you can still visually confirm the output.

### Do This: Change the Loop Condition - Counting Heads

1. Change the condition used by your while loop so that it now runs while the streak of heads is less than 3
2. Test your program by running it and visually confirming that its output is correct.

### Expected Output: Change Loop Condition - Counting Heads

Your console should look like this:

```none
1
Heads: 1
0
Heads: 1
1
Heads: 2
1
Heads: 3
1
Heads: 4
1
Heads: 5
Total Flips: 6
```
