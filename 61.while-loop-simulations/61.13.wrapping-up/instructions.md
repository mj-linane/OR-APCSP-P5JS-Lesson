## 13 Wrapping Up

You may have observed that flipping tens of thousands of coins takes some time on a computer. If we want to simulate even larger problems, it may be difficult for even a computer to complete the full simulation in a time frame that makes sense. Luckily, you should have developed some intuitions about how these problems develop, based on your earlier simulations.

Not all problems are as easy to simulate as a coin flip of course, and we’ve even seen how some problems we can simulate still take a very long time to run.

Simulations are an increasingly important tool for a variety of disciplines. Weather and traffic predictions are based on computer models that simulate weather patterns or people moving through a city. Scientific research, whether in physics, chemistry, or biology, increasingly uses simulations to develop new hypotheses and test ideas before spending the time and money to run a live experiment.

Before you use most of your favorite websites and apps, they will be tested by simulating high levels of traffic moving across the server. Simulations take advantage of computers’ amazing speed and ability to run repeated tasks, as we’ve seen through our exploration of the while loop, in order to help us learn more about the world around us.

As computers get ever faster and models improve, we are able to answer old questions more quickly and start asking new ones.
