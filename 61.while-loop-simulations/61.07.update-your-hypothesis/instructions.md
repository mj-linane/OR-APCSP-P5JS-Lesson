## 7 Update Your Hypotheses

If everything has gone well you should already be able to make a determination about your first hypothesis

- How close were your guesses on the high and low bounds for the number of flips to get 10,000 heads?
- Were you at all surprised by this result? If they were different from what you predicted why might this be the case?

Update either of your hypotheses to reflect what you observed in this first experiment.
