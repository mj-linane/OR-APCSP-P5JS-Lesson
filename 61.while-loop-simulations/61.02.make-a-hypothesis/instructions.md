## 2 Make a Hypothesis

### Coin Flip Hypothesis

For this little experiment, try flipping an actual coin. I know this is 2020 and few of us probably have coins at the read. If you don't have a real coin, use this: https://www.google.com/search?q=flip+a+coin

Over the next several exercises we are going to be **building a program that simulates flipping coins** in order to find out how many flips it takes to get **10,000 heads in total** and how many flips it takes to **get a streak of 12 heads in a row**.

We will start off with a small scale experiment using a real coin or a simulated "coin". Doing this smaller scale activity may have given you some intuition for what the outcome of the larger experiment will be, but before running an experiment it's usually a good idea to develop a hypothesis.

### Do This: Flip and Record

1. Flip a coin until you get 5 total heads. How many flips did it take?
2. Record your flips writing “H” or “T” for each flip.
3. Flip a coin until you get 3 heads in a row. How many flips did it take?
4. Record your flips by writing “H” or “T” for each flip.

We’ll be developing a simulation that flips coins for us. As a result we can test how many flips it takes to get many more total heads and longer strings of heads. Before we make our simulation, predict the following:

1. What is the most flips you expect to see in order to get 10,000 total heads?
2. What is the fewest flips you expect to see in order to get 10,000 total heads?
3. What is the most flips you expect to see in order to get 12 heads in a row?
4. What is the fewest flips you expect to see in order to get 12 heads in a row?
