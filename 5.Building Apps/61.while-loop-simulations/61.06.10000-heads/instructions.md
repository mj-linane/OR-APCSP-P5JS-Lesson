## 6 10,000 Heads

You're ready to increase the number of heads your simulation is looking for and test your first hypothesis. Before we move up to the full 10,000 heads, however, we're going to perform a quick check of our program logic. When you make changes to your program it is possible that some portion of your programming logic will stop working as you expected. In order to feel more confident about your model you will first change the number of heads you are looking for to a number that we can still visually verify (7 heads). If our code still works after making changes then we should be confident that it should work at 10,000. We will remove the intermediate output and run the full simulation!

### Do This: 10,000 Heads

1. Increase the number of heads you are looking for to 7 and visually confirm that the code is still working as you expect.
2. If everything seems to be working, comment out the console.log() command that displays the results of each flip. You can use // to comment out a single line of code. Make sure that the total count of flips still prints though!
3. Run your simulation and find out how long it takes to get to 10,000 heads. Then run it a few more times. What patterns are you noticing?

### Expected Output: 10,000 Heads

    Total Flips: 20153
