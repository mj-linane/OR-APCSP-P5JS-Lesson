# Introduction to Arrays Instructions

In this lesson, we are going to take a look at creating lists with programming. I have heard your feedback and want to try Khan Academy's content to see if it works for us. So I invited you to the Khan Academy class (invite in your email) and if you sign into Khan Academy. It should automatically join your account to the class. Khan Academy's programming is done with p5js (awesome!) but there are 2 differences. 1) They only use var instead of let/const. This is actually easier to use because just put var everywhere. It does add to the possibility of bugs so I would still recommend using let/const in your own work. 2) Everything in their program editor window is essentially the function draw() of p5js. You don't need to set them up.

So that being said, I have assigned 3 topics

1) Arrays (General overview about how arrays work in programming, no programming here)
2) Writing Clean Code (I noticed that a lot of errors and bugs were caused by misplaced brackets. So this will give you some refreshers on writing good code)
3) Programming Arrays with p5js

There is nothing to submit with this assignment so you can just mark it DONE when completed.
