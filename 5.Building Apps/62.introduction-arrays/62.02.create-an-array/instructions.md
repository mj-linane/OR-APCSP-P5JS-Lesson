## 2 Create an Array

Arrays have many features which make them different from variables, but most of what you've learned about variables also applies to arrays. For example, just like a variable:

- Arrays should be given a descriptive and meaningful name.
- Arrays are created using let/const.
- Arrays can be initialized/set using =.

### Example: Create an Array

```javascript
let myFirstArray = [100, 250, 500]
```

This array contains 3 values: 100, 250, 500. Notice that the values are separated with commas , and that the entire array is enclosed in brackets [ ] . We can use console.log to display the contents of an array just like we would a variable.

### Do This: Create An Array

1. Following the format described above create an array which contains the **_even_** numbers from 0 to 10.
2. Make sure your array named "evensArr"
3. Use console.log to display the contents of your array. Below is an example of the output your program should generate.

### Expected Output: Create An Array

```none
  (5)Â [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

When dropdown button clicked:

```none
Array(5)
  0: 2
  1: 4
  2: 6
  3: 8
  4: 10
  length: 5
```
