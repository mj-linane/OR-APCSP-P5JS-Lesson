# Infinite while Loops

While loops run until their condition becomes false, which raises an interesting question. What happens if the condition never becomes false?

In these cases the program enters what is called an *infinite loop* over the commands in the while loop, and it never reaches the rest of your program. We normally avoid infinite loops in our programs, but let's try it out to see what happens.

## P5JS function Draw()



## Do This

Starter code is provided which creates a while loop to draw circles on the screen.

- Change the while loop condition to something that will always be true The easiest way to do this is to change 50 to be a number that random will never generate such as 200.
- Run the program. Notice that it will never stop running. You may even get an error from your browser. It's possible you may even need to close the browser window and reload the page.
- Find a condition using < or > that will also cause an infinite loop.
